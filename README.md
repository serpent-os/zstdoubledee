# zstd-d

[libzstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd) bindings for the D language.

## Building

zstd-d supports both Meson and Dub.

To build with Dub, run `dub build`.

To build with Meson, run `meson setup build && meson compile -C build`. Should you prefer to build zst-d statically, pass `-Dprefer_static=true` to `meson setup`.
